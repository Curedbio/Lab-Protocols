##H2 Introduciotn
We often associate our physical characteristics to our DNA, but what exactly is DNA?
Deoxyribonucleic acid (ONA) belongs to a major class of macromolecules known as nucleic
acids. Their major function is to store genetic information in the form of base pair sequences.
DNA is composed of a chain of nucleotides, which each consist of a nitrogenous base
(Adenine, Guanine, Thymine, or Cytosine), a sugar (deoxyribose), anda phosphate group.
Two DNA strands form a structure known as a double-helix: each strand is connected to
another strand through hydrogen bonds between the nitrogenous bases, forming a base pair. In
a cellular context, DNA provides the blueprints needed to construct proteins - the machinery of
lite.
