# Casein Precipitation
## Introduction
Milk is an emulsion or colloid of butterfat globules within a water-based fluid that contains dissolved carbohydrates and protein
aggregates with minerals. Normal bovine milk contains 30–35 grams of protein per liter. There are four different types of casein
proteins: αs1-, αs2-, β-, and κ-caseins of which about 80% is arranged in casein micelles, being the k-casein the outermost layer.   
These kappa-casein molecules all have a negative electrical charge and therefore repel each other, keeping the micelles separated
under normal conditions and in a stable colloidal suspension in the water-based surrounding fluid.  

The pH of milk ranges from 6.4 to 6.8 and it changes over time. Milk from other bovines and non-bovine mammals varies in  
composition but has a similar pH. That pH value is known as the isoelectric point (IEP) of the protein and is generally the pH at
which the protein is least soluble. For casein, the IEP is approximately 4.6 and it is the pH value at which acid casein is  
precipitated. In milk, which has a pH of about [6.4-6.8], the casein micelles have a net negative charge and are quite stable.  
During the addition of acid to milk, the negative charges on the outer surface of the micelle are neutralized (the phosphate groups
are protonated), and the neutral protein precipitates.   

## Reagents
### DIY
· Centrifuge    
· Raw milk - 100ml  
· Vinegar or lemon juice - 10ml, dilluted with destilled water (pH must be ~4.6)

· 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubs  

### Lab
· Raw milk - 100ml  
· 0.2N HCl - 50ml  
· Diethyl ether - 50ml  
· 50% Ethanol - 50ml  
· Whatman No 1 filter paper strip (Size 25×50mm) - 2 no.  
· 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubs  

## Protocol
### DIY
1. Add 500uL of milk intro 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tub.
2. Add 500uL of acid intro 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tub.
3. Mix by invertion. 
4. Centrifuge 1500 rpm @ 3 minutes, at room temperature
5. Discard supertant. The white precipitate are, mainly, the milk proteins (80% casein).

### Lab
1. Measure 100ml of milk in a measuring cylinder and transfer 25ml of milk to four Oakridge centrifuge tubes each.
2.  Centrifuge 4000 rpm @ 20 minutes, at room temperature. 
This is done to remove the fats and lipids from the mixture.  
3. After centrifugation, carefully remove the fats and lipids from the surface of the milk with a spatula.
4. Transfer the milk from all the tubes into a beaker and add equal volume of distilled water and stir well and check the pH.
5. Start adding 0.2N HCl drop by drop into the milk mixture and stir well.  
**Note:** Precipitate should appear around pH 4.6.  
6. Allow it to sediment.  
7. Decant the supernatant using a filter paper and funnel.  
8. Wash the precipitate with distilled water to remove the salts, with the aim of filter paper and funnel.  
9. Repeat wahses with diethyl ether and ethanol.  
10. Allow to dry the precipitate.  
11. Weight the casein and record it.
