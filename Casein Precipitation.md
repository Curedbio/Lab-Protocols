## Introduction
Milk is an emulsion or colloid of butterfat globules within a water-based fluid that contains dissolved carbohydrates and protein 
aggregates with minerals. Normal bovine milk contains 30–35 grams of protein per liter. There are four different types of casein 
proteins: αs1-, αs2-, β-, and κ-caseins of which about 80% is arranged in casein micelles, being the k-casein the outermost layer. 
These kappa-casein molecules all have a negative electrical charge and therefore repel each other, keeping the micelles separated 
under normal conditions and in a stable colloidal suspension in the water-based surrounding fluid.
The pH of milk ranges from 6.4 to 6.8 and it changes over time. Milk from other bovines and non-bovine mammals varies in 
composition but has a similar pH. That pH value is known as the isoelectric point (IEP) of the protein and is generally the pH at 
which the protein is least soluble. For casein, the IEP is approximately 4.6 and it is the pH value at which acid casein is 
precipitated. In milk, which has a pH of about [6.4-6.8], the casein micelles have a net negative charge and are quite stable. 
During the addition of acid to milk, the negative charges on the outer surface of the micelle are neutralized (the phosphate groups 
are protonated), and the neutral protein precipitates.  

## Reagents
⋅⋅* Centrifuge X-rpm   
⋅⋅* Milk  
⋅⋅* Acid (dilution, pH), vinegar/lemon; 0.2N HCl (50ml)  
⋅⋅*  1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubs  
⋅⋅* Raw milk - 100ml  
⋅⋅* 0.2N HCl - 50ml  
⋅⋅* Diethyl ether - 50ml  
⋅⋅* 50% Ethanol - 50ml  
⋅⋅* Whatman No 1 filter paper strip (Size 25×50mm) - 2 no.  

## Protocol
### DIY
1. Add 500uL of milk intro 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tub.
2. Add 500uL of acid intro 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tub.
3. Centrifuge 1500 rpm @ 3 minutes
4. Discard supertant. The white precipitate are the milk proteins, 80% casein.

### Lab
1. Measure 100ml of milk in a measuring cylinder and transfer 25ml of milk to four Oakridge centrifuge tubes each.
2. Centrifuge the milk in a centrifuge at 4000rpm at room temperature (25- 30o C) for 20 minutes. This is done to remove the fats 
and lipids from the mixture.
3. After centrifugation, carefully remove the fats and lipids from the surface of the milk with a spatula.
4. Then transfer the milk from all the tubes into a beaker and add equal volume of distilled water and stir well. Now check the pH.
5. Start adding 0.2N HCl drop by drop into the milk mixture and stir well.  
**Note:** The PH at which precipitation (white curdy substances) appears. The pH should be 4.6.
6. Take the curdy precipitate and allow it to sediment.
7. Now decant the supernatant using a filter paper and funnel and wash the precipitate with distilled water to remove the salts, 
then wash with diethyl ether and ethanol.
8. Dry the precipitate and take the weight of the casein and record it.
