milk, in its natural state, is negativelu charged. the negative charge permites the dispresion of the casein ion the milk. 
when an acid is addeto to thge mil (vinegar), the h+ concetration neutralizes de negatibvely charged casein miceelles (a

##H2 Reagents
Centriguge X-rpm
Milk
Acid (dilution, pH), vinegar/lemon
1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubs

##H2 Protocol
1. Add 500uL of milk intro 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tub.
2. Add 500uL of acid intro 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tub.
3. Centrigufe 1500 rpm @ 3 mintues
4. Discard supertant. The white precipitate are the milk proteins, 80% casein.
